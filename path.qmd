## Mediation analysis

A single mediation analysis is based on the estimation of the four pathways, w, a, b, and c shown in @fig-path001. In @fig-path001 A, the "w" path represents the total X→Y effect. In @fig-path001 B, the "a" path represents the X→M effect, the "b" path represents the M→Y effect, and the "c" path represents the direct X→Y effect. In traditional mediation analysis, the paths coefficients are estimated using linear regression equations.

Mediation analysis is based on the assumption of temporal precedence of the independent variable X, mediator, and outcome, which means that changes in the X are assumed to precede changes in the mediator, and that changes in the mediator are assumed to precede changes in the outcome.

It is important to note that, like any regression-based analysis, mediation analysis cannot establish causal associations unless it is grounded in an experimental design. Drawing causal inferences requires rigorous methodological controls, including random assignment, temporal precedence, and the elimination of alternative explanations.

**Direct and indirect effects**

Mediation analysis decomposes the total X→Y effect (w) into a direct effect (c) and an indirect effect through a mediator variable, which is the product of a and b (axb).

## Example

Assume that previous research has demonstrated that higher grades are associated with increased happiness: X (grades) → Y (happiness) (@fig-path002 A). In our theory, we also hypothesize that good grades enhance self-esteem, which in turn increases happiness: X (grades) → M (self-esteem) → Y (happiness) (@fig-path001 B).

### Baron & Kenny method

The following shows the basic steps for mediation analysis suggested by Baron & Kenny (1986) [@baron1986]. A mediation analysis is comprised of three sets of regression: (1) X → Y, (2) X → M, and (3) X + M → Y. This 3-step method used to describe a mediation effect. Steps 1 and 2 use basic linear regression while steps 3 use multiple regression.

-   **Step 1:** Estimate the association between X on Y (grades on happiness). The **total effect** “w” must be significantly different from 0. If there is no association between X and Y, there is nothing to mediate.

![Total effect of X on Y.](images/path4.png){width="65%"}

$$Y = intercept \ + \text{w} \cdot X + e$$

where $e$ is the residual error of the model (i.e. ).

 

![](images/path8.png){width="55%"}

$$happiness = 2.86 \ + 0.40 \cdot grades$$ Therefore, the total effect w = 0.40 is statistical significant (p\<0.001).

(**NOTE:** Even if we don’t find a significant association between X and Y, we could move forward to the next step if we have a good theoretical background about their association.)

 

-   **Step 2:** Estimate the association between X on M (grades on self-esteem). Path “a” must be significantly different from 0; The independent variable and the mediator must be associated. If X and M have no association, M is just a third variable that may or may not be associated with Y. A mediation makes sense only if X affects M.

![The effect of X on M.](images/path5.png){#fig-path5 width="65%"}

$$M = intercept \ + \text{a} \cdot X + e$$

where $e$ is the residual error of the model.

 

![](images/path9.png){width="55%"}

$$selfesteem = 1.50 \ + 0.56 \cdot grades$$ Therefore, the effect of X on M (a = 0.56) is statistical significant (p\<0.001).

 

-   **Step 3:** Estimate the effects of both X and M on Y. Path “b” must be significantly different from 0; mediator and outcome must be associated. Additionally, the path “c” should be non-significant and nearly 0. The effect of X on Y will disappear (or at least weaken) when M is included in the regression. The effect of X on Y goes through M.

![The effects of both X and M on Y.](images/path6.png){#fig-path6 width="65%"}

$$Y = intercept \ + c \cdot X + \text{b} \cdot M + e$$

where $e$ is the residual error of the model.

 

![](images/path10.png){width="55%"}

$$happiness = 1.90 \ + 0.04 \cdot grades + 0.64 \cdot selfesteem$$

Therefore, the effect of M (self-esteem) on Y (happiness), controlling for X (grades), is statistically significant (b = 0.64, p \< 0.001), whereas the effect of X (grades) on Y (happiness), controlling for M (self-esteem), is weakened and not statistically significant (c = 0.04, p = 0.719).

 

**Total, direct and indirect effects**

-   The total effect (w = 0.40) is just the coefficient (w) we would find by fitting a simple regression model (e.g., $Y = intercept \ + \text{w} \cdot X$).

-   The indirect effect is the effect of X on Y, through the mediator M. It’s obtained by multiplying $a \times b = 0.56 \times 0.64 = 0.36$.

-   The direct effect (c = 0.04) is the partial effect of of X on Y after controlling for M.

![Direct and inderect effects.](images/path7.png){#fig-path7 width="65%"}

In practice, a simple mediation model decompose the total effect of X on Y, in a direct and indirect effect. Therefore:

$$w = c + (a \times b) = 0.04 + (0.56 \times 0.64) = 0.04 + 0.36 = 0.40$$

### Mediation Using Jamovi

On the Jamovi top menu navigate to

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A(Analyses) -.-> B(medmod) -.-> C(Mediation)
```

as shown below in @fig-path11.

![In the menu at the top, choose Analyses -\> medmod -\> Mediation.](images/path11.png){#fig-path11 width="75%"}

 

The Mediation dialog box opens. From the left-hand pane drag the variable `happiness` into the *Dependent Variable* field, the variable `selfesteem` into the *Mediator* field, and the `grades` variable into the *Predictor* field as shown below (@fig-path12).

Additionally, check *Labels*, *Test Statistics*, *Confidence interval*, *Percent mediation*, *Path Estimates*, and *Estimate plot*.

![Mediation box choices.](images/path12.png){#fig-path12 width="75%"}

First, @fig-path13 presents the path estimates (regression coefficients):

-   a=0.56 (p \<0.001)
-   b=0.64 (\<0.001)
-   c = 0.04 (p = 0.714).

![Path estimates.](images/path13.png){#fig-path13 width="75%"}

 

Second, @fig-path14 presents the mediation estimates:

-   The indirect effect ($a \times b = 0.36$; p \<0.001).
-   The direct effect (c = 0.04; p = 0.714)
-   The total effect (w = c + axb = 0.40; p\<0.001)

![Mediation estimates.](images/path14.png){#fig-path14 width="75%"}

 

We can also represent the mediation estimates in a plot:

![Mediation estimates plot.](images/path15.png){#fig-path15 width="75%"}

 

## Conditional mediation model

-   Mediation analysis is intended to understand the mechanisms through which impacts. It is characterized by direct and indirect effects.

-   Moderation analysis consists in understanding the conditions which alter the association between X and Y. It is characterized by conditional effect.

-   **Conditional process analysis** is used to understand the conditions that affect the mechanisms by which a variable transmits its effect on another. It is characterized by conditional direct and indirect effect.

It is also called “moderated mediation”. Due to the complexity of human and social processes, conditional mediation models may generally be more appropriate than mediation and moderation models only.

Once we are familiar with mediation and moderation models, the intuition behind conditional process models is straightforward. When one of the paths of a mediation model is moderated, the corresponding direct or indirect effect becomes a conditional effect $\theta$.

### Importing data

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-glbwarm1
#| fig-cap: Table with raw data.

DT::datatable(dat2, extensions = c('Scroller', 'Buttons'), rownames = FALSE,
              options = list(deferRender = F, dom = 'Bt', scrollY = 452, scroller = TRUE, scrollX = T, pageLength = 10, buttons = 
      list(list(
        extend = 'csv',
        filename = 'glbwarm'
      ))))

```

Open the dataset named "glbwarm" from the file tab in the menu (@fig-glbwarm1).

The dataset contains the following variables:

-   `govact`: the extent to which the participant supports various policies or actions by the U.S. government to mitigate the threat of global climate change (e.g., how much the participant supports increasing government investment for developing alternative energy like biofuels, wind, or solar).

-   `negemot`: how frequently the participant reported feeling concerned, worried, and alarmed when thinking about climate change.

-   `posemot`: how frequently reported feeling “hopeful,” “encouraged,” and “optimistic” about global climate change.

-   `sex`: 0 = female, 1 = male.

### Regression equations for the model

Our model is specified by two regression equations, one for M and one for Y.

-   **Regression equation for M:**

$$M = intercept \ + a_1 \cdot X + a_2 \cdot Z + a_3 \cdot XZ$$

which is equivalent to

$$M = intercept \ + (a_1 + a_3Z) \cdot X + a_2 \cdot Z$$

where $θ_{X\rightarrow M}=a_1 + a_3Z$ is the conditional effect of X on M.

 

![Linear regression dialog box for M.](images/path17.png){#fig-path17 width="65%"}

 

![Model coefficients for Y.](images/path18.png){#fig-path18 width="65%"}

For females (Z=0): $θ_{X\rightarrow M}=0.117$.

For males (Z=1): $θ_{X\rightarrow M}=0.117 + 0.010 = 0.127$.

 

-   **Regression equation for Y**

$$Y = intercept \ + c_1 \cdot X + c_2 \cdot Z + c_3 \cdot XZ + b \cdot M$$

which is equivalent to

$$Y = intercept \ + (c_1 + c_3Z) \cdot X + c_2 \cdot Z + b \cdot M$$

where $θ_{X\rightarrow Y}=c_1 + c_3Z$ is the **conditional direct** effect of X on Y.

 

![Linear regression dialog box for Y.](images/path19.png){#fig-path19 width="75%"}

 

![Model coefficients for Y.](images/path20.png){#fig-path20 width="75%"}

Therefore, the **conditional direct** effects of X on Y are:

For females (Z=0): $θ_{X\rightarrow Y} = 0.373$.

For males (Z=1): $θ_{X\rightarrow Y} = 0.373 + 0.265 = 0.638$.

 

### The conditional indirect effects

The **conditional indirect** effect of X on Y through M is the product of the conditional effect of X on M and the effect $b$ of M on Y:

-   For females (Z=0): $θ_{X\rightarrow M} \times b = 0.117 \times (-0.03) = -0.0035$.

-   For males (Z=1): $θ_{X\rightarrow M} \times b = 0.127 \times (-0.03) = -0.0038$.

 

### Total effects

![Path diagram with model estimates for females (Z=0).](images/path24.png){#fig-path24 width="75%"}

Therefore, the **total effect** is the sum of conditional direct and indirect effects: 0.373 + (- 0.0035) = 0.367.

![Path diagram with model estimates for males (Z=1).](images/path25.png){#fig-path25 width="75%"}

Therefore, the **total effect** is the sum of conditional direct and indirect effects: 0.638 + (- 0.0038) = 0.634.

## Path analysis

### Basic concepts

Path analysis can be used to test more complex theories of observed variables. In this example, we look at the theory of planned behavior (TPB). This theory is a psychological theory that links beliefs to behavior. In its simplified form, the TPB proposes that an individual's intention to perform a specific behavior influences the individual’s decision to enact that behavior, and attitude toward the behavior, perception of norms pertaining to that behavior, and perception of control over performing that behavior influence the individual’s intention to perform the behavior.

We can specify the Theory of Planned Behavior as a path diagram by drawing the observed variables and the directional associations (paths) between the variables as implied by the theory, where rectangles represent the variables and directional arrows represent the directional relations between variables, which is depicted in the path diagram below:

![Model diagram.](images/path27.png){#fig-path27 width="95%"}

-   **Exogenous variables:** Independent variables that are influenced by factors outside the model and, in turn, influence endogenous variables. In path diagrams, arrows originate from exogenous variables but do not point to them.

-   **Endogenous variables:** Dependent variables that are explained by exogenous variables in the model. Arrows point toward them and these represent causal paths. Note that an endogenous variable may also be specified as the predictor of another endogenous variable, as is the case in our example path diagram.

-   **Path coefficients** are regression coefficients (typically denoted as $\beta_1-\beta_4$, or sometimes as $p_1-p_4$) that represent direct effects of one variable on another.

-   **Variances** are typically represented as curved double-sided arrows, where both arrows point to the same variable. **Covariances** are also represented as double-sided arrows in which the arrows connect two distinct variables.

-   **(Residual) error terms** (which are sometimes called disturbances) are added to **endogenous variables**.

The equations of this model are:

$$intention = intercept +  \beta_1 attitude + \beta_2 norms + \beta_3 control + e$$

and

$$behavior = intercept + \beta_4 intention + e$$

### Importing data

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-PlannedBehavior1
#| fig-cap: Table with raw data.

DT::datatable(dat3, extensions = c('Scroller', 'Buttons'), rownames = FALSE,
              options = list(deferRender = F, dom = 'Bt', scrollY = 452, scroller = TRUE, scrollX = T, pageLength = 10, buttons = 
      list(list(
        extend = 'csv',
        filename = 'PlannedBehavior'
      ))))

```

Open the dataset named "PlannedBehavior" from the file tab in the menu (@fig-PlannedBehavior1).

### Path Analysis using Jamovi

This analysis can be achieved in Jamovi as follows:

On the top menu navigate to

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A(Analyses) -.-> B(SEM) -.-> C(Path Analysis)
```

as shown below in @fig-path11.

![In the menu at the top, choose Analyses -\> SEM -\> Path Analysis.](images/path29.png){#fig-path29 width="95%"}

 

The Path Analysis dialog box opens. From the left-hand pane drag the variables `behavior` and `intention` into the *Endogenous Variable* field, and the variables `attitude`, `norms` into the *Mediator* field, and the `grades` variable into the *Predictor* field as shown below (@fig-path003).

![Path analysis dialog box.](images/path003.png){#fig-path003 width="75%"}

 

Next we specify the variables of each endogenous variable (@fig-path30). First we select on the right panel the endogenous model that needs to be set, then select the variable(s) and fill the Models for Endogenous Vars field clicking the arrow.

![Endogenous Model determination.](images/path30.png){#fig-path30 width="75%"}

 

Within the "Parameter Options" menu, also select the *Indirect Effects* (@fig-path006).

![Parameters Options. Check Inderect Effects.](images/path006.png){#fig-path006 width="75%"}

 

The direct effects (path coefficients) are obtained from regression analysis.

The table in @fig-path31 summarizes hypotheses testing results of the study.

![Parameter Estimates of the model.](images/path31.png){#fig-path31 width="85%"}

The path coefficient (i.e., regression coefficient b) between attitude and intention is statistically significant and positive (b = 0.352, p \< 0.001). The path coefficient between norms and intention is statistically significant and positive (b = 0.153, p = 0.010). The path coefficient between control and intention is statistically significant and positive (b = 0.275, p \< 0.001). Finally, the path coefficient between intention and behavior is statistically significant and positive (b = 0.453, p \< 0.001).

 

The intercepts of the equations of the model are following:

![The intercepts of the equation model.](images/path401.png){#fig-path401 width="75%"}

According the outputs of @fig-path31 and @fig-path401, the equations can be expressed as follows:

$$intention = 0.586 + 0.352 \cdot attitude + 0.153 \cdot norms + 0.275 \cdot control$$

and

$$behavior = 1.743 + 0.453 \cdot intention$$

 

Under the “R-Squared” table, we see the unadjusted R2 value for the outcome variable intention, which is equal to 0.369; that is, collectively, attitude, norms, and control explain 36.9% of the variance in intention. Additionally, intention explains 19.8% of the variance in behavior (@fig-path004).

![R-Squared values of the model.](images/path004.png){#fig-path004 width="45%"}

 

Moreover, the indirect effects are reported in the following table:

![Indirect effects.](images/path005.png){#fig-path005 width="100%"}

For example, the estimate for the indirect effect of the path attitude=\>intention=\>behavior is calculated as 0.35\*0.45 = 0.16.

 

Using path analysis, we can also explicitly model the variance of the exogenous variables (e.g., attitude-attitude variance=0.93), the covariances (correlations) between the exogenous variables (e.g., norms-attitude covariance= 0.20), and the residual errors of the endogenous variables in the model (e.g., intention res. error = 0.53).

![Variances and Covariances estimates.](images/path32.png){#fig-path32 width="95%"}

 

We can also present the model with a path diagram. All options regard aesthetics of the diagram are shown in @fig-path34.
