## Basic concepts in SEM

In the second half of the 1960s, a significant development emerged from the collaboration of researchers working on Factor Analysis (and the concept of latent variables) and Path Analysis (which introduced the concepts of exogenous/endogenous variables and direct/indirect effects). This **integration** gave rise to Path Analysis with latent variables—now known as **Structural Equation Modelling (SEM)**.

### Measurement and Structural Models

The general SEM model can be decomposed into two submodels: a **measurement model**, and a **structural model** (@fig-sem1).

![The measurement model and structural model.](images/sem1.png){#fig-sem1 width="90%"}

**The measurement model**

The measurement model defines associations between the observed and unobserved variables. In other words, it provides the link between scores on measuring instruments (observed indicator variables, $x_1,...,x_6$) and the underlying structures they are designed to measure (unobserved latent variables $\xi_1$, $\eta_1$). The measurement model, then, represents the **CFA model** described earlier in @sec-cfa in that it specifies the pattern by which each measure loads on a particular factor.

**The structural model**

The structural model defines associations among the **unobserved variables** (latent variables, $\xi_1$ and $\eta_1$). Accordingly, it specifies the manner by which particular latent variables directly or indirectly influence changes in the values of certain other latent variables in the model. In @fig-sem1 the latent variable $\xi_1$ is exogenous, while the latent variable $\eta_1$ is endogenous.

### Effects in SEM

In SEM two types of effects are estimated: **direct and indirect effects** (@fig-sem3).

![Hypothesized Structural Equation Model (SEM).](images/sem3.png){#fig-sem3 width="90%"}

Direct effects (p1), indicated by a straight arrow, represent the association between one latent variable to another and this is indicated using single-directional arrows (e.g., the green arrow that connects directly $\xi_2$ and $\eta_2$). The arrows are used in SEM to indicate directionality and do not imply causality.

Indirect effects ($p2*p3$), on the other hand, reflect the association between an independent latent variable (exogenous variable) (e.g., $\xi_2$) and a dependent latent variable (endogenous variable) (e.g., $\eta_2$) that is **mediated** by one or more latent variables (e.g., $\eta_1$). This path is illustrated by the red arrows in @fig-sem3.

### Parameters in SEM

There are three types of parameters to be specified:

-   **Directional effects:** These are **regression coefficients** (e.g., $l_1-l_{12}$ in @fig-sem3) that represent the associations between observed indicators and latent variables (referred to as **factor loadings**), as well as the associations between latent variables and other latent variables (referred to as **path coefficients**; e.g., $p_1-p_4$ in @fig-sem3). Note also that the path coefficients from $e_1 - e_{12}$ to the observed variables $X_i - X_{12}$ are fixed to 1.

-   **Variances:** Variances in a structural equation model account for unexplained variability in both observed and latent variables. For observed indicators, they represent **measurement error**—the variance not accounted for by the latent factor the indicator is intended to measure (e.g., the purple circles $e_1-e_{12}$ in @fig-sem3). For exogenous latent variables, they are represented with the green double-headed arrows in @fig-sem3. For endogenous latent variables, they reflect the variance in an endogenous (dependent) latent variable that is not explained by the exogenous (independent) latent variables predicting it in the model (e.g., the purple circles $resid_1, resid_2$ in @fig-sem3).

-   **Covariances:** These parameters represent non-directional associations among independent (exogenous) latent variables and these exist when a researcher hypothesizes that the factors are correlated ($\phi_1$ shown as the curved double-headed orange arrow connected ($\xi_1$ and $\xi_2$ in @fig-sem3).

## Steps in Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)

The main steps of SEM are following (@fig-sem3) [@stoffels2023]:

1.  **Model specification:** Define the hypothesized associations between variables based on theory. Establish a satisfactory measurement model for key concepts using latent variables. Fit regression paths between concepts (structural model).

2.  **Model identification:** Model identification refers to determining whether there is sufficient information in the observed data to estimate the model's parameters uniquely. A model is **overidentified** when there are more known data points (usually variances and covariances) than free parameters—this is ideal because it allows for both parameter estimation and model fit testing. A **just-identified model** has an equal number of knowns and free parameters; while it can be estimated, its fit to the data cannot be tested. An **underidentified model** has fewer knowns than parameters, meaning it lacks enough information to estimate all parameters, making it impossible to fit the model reliably.

3.  **Model estimation:** It refers to the process of using statistical techniques to calculate the values of model parameters, such as factor loadings, path coefficients, and error or residual variances. Common estimation methods include Maximum Likelihood (ML), Generalized Least Squares (GLS), and Bayesian estimation, with ML being the most widely used.

4.  **Assess goodness of fit:** Assessing goodness of fit in SEM involves evaluating how well the proposed model reproduces the observed data. Key measures include the Chi-square test, and approximate fit indices like the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI).

5.  **Model respecification:** Model respecification in SEM refers to the process of modifying a model to improve its fit to the data after initial estimation. If the original model does not fit well, researchers may adjust it by adding or removing paths, correlating error terms, or reassigning indicators—guided by both theory and statistical diagnostics like modification indices.

## EXAMPLE Data and the model

The theoretical framework for our example is grounded in understanding how various student background factors influence academic achievement. The observed variables are: motivation (motiv), harmony (harm), stability (stabi), negative parental psychology (ppsych), socioeconomic status (ses), verbal IQ (verbal), reading (read), arithmetic (arith), and spelling (spell).

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-achievement0
#| fig-cap: Table with raw data.

DT::datatable(dat, extensions = c('Scroller', 'Buttons'), rownames = FALSE,
              options = list(deferRender = F, dom = 'Bt', scrollY = 452, scroller = TRUE, scrollX = T, pageLength = 10, buttons = 
      list(list(
        extend = 'csv',
        filename = 'achievement'
      ))))

```

In this example, nine observed variables are clustered into hypothetical latent constructs based on prior knowledge or theory. The three hypothesized latent constructs are adjustment, risk, and achievement. **Adjustment** is defined by the observed variables motivation, harmony, and stability. Similarly, **risk** is defined by negative parental psychology, socioeconomic status, and verbal IQ. It also correlates with the Adjustment latent variable. Finally, **achievement** is composed of reading, arithmetic, and spelling (@fig-sem4).

![Structural Equation Model (SEM) for how various student background factors influence academic achievement.](images/sem4.png){#fig-sem4 width="90%"}

Parameters of the model in @fig-sem4:

-   **Fixed:** 9 error term regression paths (fixed to 1), 3 factor loadings (fixed to 1), 1 residual regression path (fixed to 1).

-   **Free:** 9 error variances ($e_1,..,e_9$), 6 factor loadings ($l_2, l_3, l_4, l_5, l_6, l_8, l_9$), 2 path coefficients ($p1$ and $p_2$), 1 residual variance, 2 variances of the exogenous variables (green double-headed arrows), 1 covariance (orange double-headed arrow).

Therefore, we have 13 fixed parameters and 21 free parameters.

## SEM in Jamovi

On the Jamovi top menu navigate to

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A(Analyses) -.-> B(SEM) -.-> C(Structural Equation Modelling)
```

as shown below (@fig-sem5).

![select SEM (interactive) from SEM icon in the menu.](images/sem5.png){#fig-sem5 width="90%"}

 

Once the Structural Equation Modeling window appears, type "Achievement" into the Latent Endogenous Variables box. Next, select the observed variables `read` (ref.), `arith`, and `spell` from the left-hand pane and move them under the "Achievement" label in the Latent Endogenous Variables box (@fig-sem6).

![Select read, arith, and spell for the endogenous variable named Achievement.](images/sem6.png){#fig-sem6 width="70%"}

Similarly, type "Adjustment" into the Latent Exogenous Variables box. Next, select the observed variables `motiv` (ref.), `harm`, and `stabi` from the left-hand pane and move them under the "Adjustment" label in the Latent Exogenous Variables box (@fig-sem6).

Next, add a new exogenous variable in the Latent Exogenous Variables box and label it “Risk”. Select the `verbal` (ref.), `ppsych`, and `ses` observed variables and from the left-hand pane and move them under the "Risk" label in the Latent Exogenous Variables box (@fig-sem6).

We also need to define the exogenous factors "Adjustment" and "Risk" as predictors of the endogenous variable "Achievement". To do this, select the desired variables and use the arrow button to transfer them into the Endogenous Variables field in the model as shown in @fig-sem7.
