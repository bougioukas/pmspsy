<h2 data-number="5.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction-to-simple-linear-regression"><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Introduction to simple linear regression</h2>
<p>Simple linear regression involves a numeric dependent (or response) variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and one independent (or explanatory) variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> that is either numeric or categorical.</p>
<p>Often it is of interest to quantify the linear association between two numeric variables, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, and given the value of one variable for an individual, to predict the value of the other variable. This is not possible from the correlation coefficient as it simply indicates the strength of the association as a single number; in order to describe the association between the values of the two variables, a technique called regression is used. In regression, we assume that a change in the independent variable, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, will lead directly to a change in the dependent variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. However, the term “dependent” does not necessarily imply a cause-and-effect relationship between the two variables.</p>
<p>We may recall from secondary/high school algebra that the equation of a line is: <span id="eq-line1"><span class="math display">\[y = \beta_o + \beta_1 \cdot x \tag{5.1}\]</span></span></p>

<li><p>The <strong>slope coefficient</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is the mean change in <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> for every one unit increase in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (<a href="#fig-line" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>5.1</span></a>).</p></li>

<p>Data of 550 infants at 1 month age was collected. The following variables were recorded:</p>
<p>• Body weight of the infant in g (weight)</p>
<p>• Body height of the infant in cm (height)</p>
<p>• Head circumference in cm (headc)</p>
<p>• Gender of the infant (gender: Female, Male)</p>
<p>• Birth order in their family (parity: Singleton, One sibling, 2 or more siblings)</p>
<p>• Education of the mother (education: tertiary, year10, year12)</p>

<p>As we can see in <a href="#fig-scat3" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>5.6</span></a>, the points seem to be scattered around a line. The scatter plot also shows that, in general, infants with high height tend to have high weight (positive association).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let’s focus on interpreting the regression table in <a href="#fig-scat9" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>5.12</span></a>. In the <strong>estimate</strong> column are the intercept <span class="math inline">\(b_o\)</span> = -5411.95 <span class="math inline">\(\approx 5412\)</span> and the slope <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> = 178.3 <span class="math inline">\(\approx 178\)</span> for height. Thus the equation of the regression line becomes:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\widehat{y} &amp;= b_o + b_1 \cdot x\\
\widehat{\text{weight}} &amp;= b_o + b_1 \cdot\text{height}\\
\widehat{\text{weight}}&amp;= -5412 + 178\cdot\text{height}
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The intercept</strong> <span class="math inline">\(b_o\)</span></p>
<p>The intercept <span class="math inline">\(b_o =5412\)</span> is the average weight for those infants with height of 0. In graphical terms, it’s where the line intersects the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> axis when <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> = 0 (<a href="#fig-intercept" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>5.13</span></a>). Note, however, that while the intercept of the regression line has a mathematical interpretation, it has no <em>physical</em> interpretation here, since observing a weight of 0 is impossible.</p>

<p>The graphical calculation of the slope from two points of the fitted line is (<a href="#fig-slope" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>5.14</span></a>):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[

\]</span> Note that, in this example, the coefficient has units g/cm.</p>
<p>Additionally, note that the sign is positive, suggesting a positive association between these two variables, meaning infants with higher height also tend to have higher weight. Recall from earlier that the correlation coefficient was <span class="math inline">\(r = 0.71\)</span>. They both have the same positive sign, but have a different value. Recall further that the correlation’s interpretation is the “strength of linear association”. The slope’s interpretation is a little different:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For every 1 cm increase in height, there is <strong>on average</strong> an associated increase of 178 g of weight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We only state that there is an <strong>associated</strong> increase and not necessarily a <strong>causal</strong> increase. In other words, just because two variables are strongly associated, it doesn’t necessarily mean that one causes the other. This is summed up in the often quoted phrase, “correlation is not necessarily causation.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, we say that this associated increase is <strong>on average</strong> 178 g of weight, because we might have two infants whose height differ by 1 cm, but their difference in weight won’t necessarily be exactly 178. What the slope of 178 is saying is that <strong>across all possible infants, the <em>average</em> difference in weight between two infants whose height differ by 1 cm is 178 g</strong>.</p>

<p>The 6th column of the regression table in <a href="#fig-scat9" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>5.12</span></a> corresponds to a <em>t-statistic</em>. The hypothesis testing for the slope is:</p>

<p>The <strong>t-statistic</strong> for the slope is defined by the following equation:</p>

<p>Observe in the above table that <strong>weight_hat</strong> contains the predicted (fitted) values <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{y}\)</span> = <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\text{weight}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The <strong>residual</strong> column is simply <span class="math inline">\(e_i = y - \widehat{y} = weight - weight\_hat\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s see, for example, the values for the first infant and have a visual representation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>observed value</strong> <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> = 3950 is infant’s weight for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> = 55.5.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>predicted value</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{y}\)</span> is the value 4483.939 on the regression line for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> = 55.5. This value is computed using the intercept and slope in the previous regression in <a href="#fig-residuals" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>5.16</span></a>: <span class="math display">\[\widehat{y} = b_o + b_1 \cdot x = -5411.953 + 178.296 \cdot 55.5 = 4483.48\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>residual</strong> is computed by subtracting the predicted (fitted) value <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{y}\)</span> from the observed value <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. The residual can be thought of as a model’s error or “lack of fit” for a particular observation. In the case of this infant, it is <span class="math inline">\(y - \widehat{y}\)</span> = 3950 - 4483.4 = -533.4 .</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A “best-fitting” line refers to the line that <strong>minimizes</strong> the <strong>sum of squared residuals (RSS)</strong>, also known as sum of squared estimate of errors (SSE) out of all possible lines we can draw through the points. The method of least squares is the most popular method used to calculate the coefficients of the regression line.</p>
<p><span id="eq-minrss"><span class="math display">\[ min(RSS) =min\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \widehat{y}_i)^2  \tag{5.5}\]</span></span></p>
<p>In <a href="#fig-min_slope" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>5.17</span></a>, we have found the minimum value of RSS (it turns out to be 97723317) and have drawn a horizontal dashed green line. At the point where this minimum touches the graph, we have read down to the x axis to find the best value of the slope. This is the value 178.</p>

<p>The quality of a linear regression fit is typically assessed using two related quantities: residual standard error (RSE) and the coefficient of determination R<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Residual standard error (RSE)</strong></p>
<p>RSE represents the average distance that the observed values fall from the regression line. Conveniently, it tells us how wrong the regression model is on average using the units of the response variable. Smaller values are better because it indicates that the observations are closer to the fitted line. In our example:</p>
<p><span id="eq-rse"><span class="math display">\[\ RSE = \sqrt{\frac{\ RSS}{n-2}}= \sqrt{\frac{\ 97723317}{550-2}}= 422.3 \tag{5.6}\]</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Coefficient of determination R</strong><span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span></p>
<p>The quality of our simple linear model is presented in <a href="#fig-scat8" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>5.18</span></a>:</p>

Figure&nbsp;5.18: The coefficient of determination <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>.
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The R<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span> is the fraction of the total variation in <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> that is explained by the regression.</p>
<p><span id="eq-r2"><span class="math display">\[\ R^2 = \frac{\ explained \ \ variation}{total \ \ variation} \tag{5.7}\]</span></span></p>
<p>The R<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span> value is called the <strong>coefficient of determination</strong> and indicates the percentage of the variance in the dependent variable that can be explained or accounted for by the independent variable. Hence, it is a measure of the <strong>‘goodness of fit’</strong> of the regression line to the data. It ranges between 0 and 1 (it won’t be negative). An R<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span> statistic that is close to 1 indicates that a large proportion of the variability in the response has been explained by the regression. A number near 0 indicates that the regression did not explain much of the variability in the response.</p>
<p>In our example takes the value 0.509. It indicates that about 50.9% of the variation in infant’s body weight can be explained by the variation of the infant’s body height. In simple linear regression <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{0.509} = 0.713\)</span> which equals to the Pearson’s correlation coefficient, r.</p>

<p>Using the same sample of 550 infants of 1 month age we want to examine how body weight is associated with the gender of the infant. Now we have an explanatory variable x that is binary (Male/Female), as opposed to the numerical explanatory variable model (height) that we used previously.</p>

<p>How can we handle this variable in a mathematical equation? Well, we will use a trick. All cases in which the respondent is Male will be coded as 1 and all other cases, in which the respondent is Female, will be coded as 0 (reference category). This allows us to enter in the gender values as numerical (note that these numbers are just indicators).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{gender} =
\begin{cases}
1 &amp; \text{if infant is Male} \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise (ref.)}

\widehat{\text{weight}} &amp;= b_o + b_1 \cdot\text{gender}

<p>Additionally, from the <em>Model Coefficients</em> section tick the box “<strong>Confidence interval</strong>” in <strong>Estimate</strong> (<a href="linear2.html#fig-linear4" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>6.16</span></a>):</p>

</ul>
<p>Therefore, the mean weight of a male infant is (4140 + 452) 4592 g which is significantly higher (on average) about 452 g relative to a female infant (p&lt;0.001). The 95% confidence interval for this estimation (the difference in means) is 358 to 545 g.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the above analysis is equivalent to run a two-sample t-test.</p>

<p>We will use the previous trick and we will create 2 dummy variables to assign numerical values to the levels of parity. So each dummy variable will represent one category of the explanatory variable and will be coded with 1 if the case falls in that category and with 0 if not.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{parity1} =
\begin{cases}
1 &amp; \text{if infant has one sibling} \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise (ref.)}
\end{cases}

<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{parity2} =
\begin{cases}
1 &amp; \text{if infant has 2 or more siblings} \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise (ref.)}
\end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<p>The equation of the regression line will have the following form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\widehat{y} &amp;= b_o + b_1 \cdot x\\
\widehat{\text{weight}} &amp;= b_o + b_1 \cdot\text{parity1} + b_2 \cdot\text{parity2}

\]</span></p>
<p>Therefore, we are including all the categories to the linear regression model except the one which is going to be used as the reference category (here is the Singleton). Actually, we create a multiple regression model which we will examine later analytically.</p>
<p>We also select from the Reference Level the “Singleton” category and from the Model Coefficients section tick the box “Confidence interval” in Estimate (<a href="#fig-scat19" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>5.24</span></a>):</p>
