Then type the condition age &gt;= 18 in the formula box and press ENTER from the keyboard (Figure 1.17).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.17: Adding a filter.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelational (or comparison) operators in Jamovi\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsymbol\nread as\n\n\n\n\n&lt;\nless than\n\n\n&gt;\ngreater than\n\n\n==\nequal to\n\n\n&lt;=\nless than or equal to\n\n\n&gt;=\ngreater than or equal to\n\n\n!=\nnot equal to\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNotice that a column named Filter 1 has been added to the Spreadsheet view.

Lines with an X are grayed out indicating that these observations are now outside of the current dataset.\nThere is also a switch where we can activate  or inactivate  the filter (note that an inactivate filter will remain visible and can be toggled to active at any time).\nIt is also possible to hide all filter columns by clicking on the eye symbol  of the filters. In this case, all filters and the filtered data will remain active but will be invisible.\nFinally, if we want to delete the filter permanently, we can click on the  of the filter .\n \n\nMultiple conditions\n\nBut we can do more complicated filters than this! Let’s say that we’re interested in the adult females. In fact we can specify this in three ways:\na) by using the and operator in “Filter 1” which means that both conditions (adults and females) in the expression must be true at the same time. Therefore, we type the expression age &gt;= 18 and sex == 'female' (Figure 1.18):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.18: Combining conditions with “and” operator in one expression.\n\n\n\nNote that in the above expression we can also use double quotes around the \"female\" (i.e., age &gt;= 18 and sex == \"female\") or even the coded value (i.e., age &gt;= 18 and sex == 2).\nb) by adding the second condition (i.e. sex == \"female\") as another expression to “Filter 1” (by clicking the small + beside the first expression) (Figure 1.19):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.19: Multiple expressions in the same filter.\n\n\n\nThis additional expression comes to be represented with its own column F1(2) (Figure 1.19), and by looking at the ticks and crosses, we can see which expression is responsible for excluding each row.\nc) adding a new “Filter 2” (by selecting the large + to the left of the filters dialog box) (Figure 1.20). In this case, we can activate or inactivate the filters separately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.20: Multiple expressions using multiple filters.\n\n\n\nWe close the filter settings by pressing the arrow in the top-right corner .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nFilters in Jamovi exclude the rows for which the expression is not true. When filters are active, all results will be based on the filtered data. If we want to see unfiltered results we will either need to delete the filter or toggle it to inactive.",

    "text": "1.9 Transforming a variable\n\n1.9.1 Transform a quantitative variable into a qualitative variable\nSometimes it can be useful to convert a quantitative variable into a qualitative variable with levels. For example, the time_spent can be categorized as follows:\n\nless than or equal to 3  “0-3”\n4 to 7  “4-7”\n8 to 11  “8-11”\ngreater than 11  “&gt;11”\n\nSelect time_spent variable and click the Transform button  from the toolbar of the Data tab. This opens the “TRANSFORMED VARIABLE” view, where we can set the name of the transformed variable such as time_spent2 and create the transformation. To do this, select the source variable, the time_spent in this case, in the Source Variable field and create a new transformation using transform field (Figure 1.21), which is initially set to ‘none’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.21: Setting up a new transformation of a variable.\n\n\n\n \nThis opens the “TRANSFORM” view where Jamovi gives each transformation a name (e.g., Transform 1; if we want we can change it). This allows us to use it again later on other variables if we wish. We can also add a description (Figure 1.22).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.22: Box for adding conditions to the transformation.\n\n\n\nNow we need to add conditions. Jamovi uses simple if ... else statements and executes each statement starting from the top. So let’s start!\nFirst, select + Add recode condition. Second, we need to fill the boxes with the information as follows (Figure 1.23):\n\nThe $source is the variable we want to transform (here time_spent)- don’t change this.\nSelect the appropriate comparison operator (here &lt;= )\nIn the next box, we will put the time_spent value we want as the cut off point (e.g., 3).\nAfter the use, add our new label (here '0-3'). If we are using text we must enclose it in '...'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.23: Adding the first condition (0-3).\n\n\n\n \nWe can add as many conditions as we want by selecting + Add recode condition. This will add a new if $source line into the box (Figure 1.24). Remember they will be executed in order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.24: Adding the second condition (4-7).\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.25: Adding the third condition (8-11).\n\n\n\n \nFinally, after the else use box just add the label for the data that does not meet the above conditions (here '&gt;11'), as shown in Figure 1.26.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.26: Adding the final label for the data that does not meet the above conditions (&gt;11).\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1.9.2 Reverse scoring of items\nTo compute the total score for all items of the RSES, we first need to reverse the scores of the negatively worded questions (3, 5, 8, 9, and 10). To do this, we can follow these simple steps.\nIn the Variables tab, we select the checkboxes for the q3, q5, q8, q9, and q10 variables, as shown in Figure 1.27.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.27: Select the variables to be reversed.\n\n\n\n \nAfter that, we click on the Transform button ) from the toolbar of the Variables tab to open the Transform variable settings. Then, we Create New Transform, as shown in Figure 1.28.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.28: Open the Transform variable settings.\n\n\n\n \nIn the Transform view, we enter _R as a suffix for the variable names and specify 3-$source in the condition box, as shown in Figure 1.29.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.29: Transform variable settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.30: Data with the reversed variables.",

    "text": "2.1 One-way between-subjects Analysis of Variance (One-way ANOVA)\nThe one-way between-subjects analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) is used to compare more than two independent (unrelated or unpaired) samples. We may think of it as an extension of Student’s t-test.\nAlthough, ANOVA can detect whether there are mean differences between groups, it does not identify which groups are different from the others. At first, we might consider to compare all groups in pairs with t-tests. However, this approach can lead to incorrect conclusions due to the multiple comparisons problem. Each additional t-test increases the likelihood of making at least one Type I error (false positive) across the set (often called a family) of comparisons.\nThis is why, after an ANOVA test concludes that at least one difference exists between groups (omnibus analysis), we should perform statistical tests that account for the number of comparisons (post hoc tests). Some of the most commonly used post hoc tests include the Tukey test, Bonferroni correction, and Holm test.",

The groups contain students who have studied for either zero, two, four, six, or eight months prior to taking the SAT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Table with raw data.\n\n\n\n\nOpen the dataset named “sat” from the file tab in the menu (Figure 2.2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: The sat dataset.\n\n\n\n \nWe prepare the data as follows (Figure 2.3):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: The modified dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Research question\nA quaziexperimental study explored the effect of preparation time on SAT performance, with students having studied for different duration (zero, two, four, six, or eight months). The question of interest is whether the mean SAT score differs across these preparation times.\n\n\n2.1.3 Hypothesis testing for the one-way ANOVA test\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNull hypothesis and alternative hypothesis\n\n\n\n\n\\(H_0\\): all group means are equal (the means of SAT in the five conditions are equal: \\(\\mu_{1} = \\mu_{2} = \\mu_{3} = \\mu_{4} = \\mu_{5}\\))\n\\(H_1\\): at least one group mean differs from the others (there is at least one group with mean SAT score different from the others)\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Assumptions\n\nThe dependent variable, satscore, should be approximately normally distributed for all groups. To increase the number of observations used in assessing normality, we often examine the residuals from the ANOVA model for the entire dataset using a normal quantile plot of the standardized residuals (Normal Q-Q plot).\nThe data in groups have similar variance (also named as homogeneity of variance or homoscedasticity).\n\n\n\n2.1.5 Descriptive statistics and plots\nOn the Jamovi top menu navigate to\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A(Exploration) -.-&gt; B(Descriptives)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nas shown below in Figure 2.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Select exploration and Desctriptives.\n\n\n\nHighlight satscore in the left panel and click it (or drug it) over the the Variables. Then highlight the group and click it over the Split by (Figure 2.5). Additionally, select variables across rows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Descriptive dialog box.\n\n\n\n \nThe default descriptive statistics are shown in Figure 2.6: the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: The modified dataset.\n\n\n\nTo generate boxplots, click the Plots, and check Box plot, Data, and Mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Selection of boxplots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Boxplots.\n\n\n\nThe plot suggests that the mean SAT score (black square) increases as the months progress, suggesting a positive association between time and SAT score improvement.\n\n\n2.1.6 ANOVA (omnibus analysis)\nOn the Jamovi top menu navigate to\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A(Analyses) -.-&gt; B(ANOVA) -.-&gt; C(ANOVA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nas shown below in Figure 2.9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: Conducting ANOVA test in Jamovi. In the menu at the top, choose Analyses -&gt; ANOVA  -&gt; ANOVA.\n\n\n\nNOTE: There is also a One-Way ANOVA menu option. This version of the ANOVA analysis does not have all the options we want so we are not going to use this method, so we will run our analysis via “ANOVA” rather than “One-Way ANOVA”.\n \nIn the ANOVA dialog box, highlight satscore in the left panel and click it (or drug it) over the the Dependent Variable. Then highlight the group and click it over the Fixed Factors (Figure 2.10). Additionally, check \\(\\eta^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: ANOVA dialog box.\n\n\n\n \nAssumptions Checks\nClick the Assumptions Checks, and check Homogeneity test, Normality test, and Q-Q plot (Figure 2.11).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.11: Assumption selections for ANOVA.\n\n\n\n\nNormality of distributions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember: Hypothesis testing for Shapiro-Wilk test for normality\n\n\n\n\\(H_{0}\\): the data came from a normally distributed population.\n\\(H_{1}\\): the data tested are not normally distributed.\n\nIf p − value &lt; 0.05, reject the null hypothesis, \\(H_{0}\\).\nIf p − value ≥ 0.05, do not reject the null hypothesis, \\(H_{0}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.12: Normality test.\n\n\n\nThe Shapiro-Wilk test of normality suggests normal distributions (p=0.56 &gt; 0.05; \\(H_o\\) is not rejected).\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.13: Normal Q-Q plot.\n\n\n\nThe data points mostly fall along the diagonal line, indicating that the residuals are approximately normally distributed. Additionally, there are no extreme deviations or systematic patterns, suggesting that normality holds well.\n \n\nEquality of variances\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember: Hypothesis testing for Levene’s test for equality of variances\n\n\n\n\\(H_{0}\\): the variances of WeightLoss in all groups are equal (\\(σ^2_1=σ^2_2=σ^2_3=σ^2_4=σ^2_5\\))\n\\(H_{1}\\): the variances of satscore differ between groups (\\(σ^2_i\\neq σ^2_j\\), where \\(i,j= 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\) and \\(i\\neq j\\))\n\nIf p − value &lt; 0.05, reject the null hypothesis, \\(H_{0}\\).\nIf p − value ≥ 0.05, do not reject the null hypothesis, \\(H_{0}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.14: Levene’s test.\n\n\n\nSince p = 0.239 &gt; 0.05, the \\(H_0\\) of the Levene’s test is not rejected and the variances of the five conditions are comparable; in short, it appears that the assumption of homogeneity of variance is not violated.\n \nANOVA table\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.15: Summary table of ANOVA.\n\n\n\n \nIn Figure 2.15, the F-statistic is calculated as follows:\n\\[F= \\frac{Mean \\ Square \\ between \\ groups}{Mean \\ Square \\ within \\ groups} = \\frac{Mean \\ Square \\ group}{Mean \\ Square \\ residuals} = \\frac{57624.3}{1325.7} = 43.467\\]\nNote that we compare this value to an F-distribution (F-test). The degrees of freedom in the numerator (df1) and the denominator (df2) are 4 and 30, respectively.\nThe p-value &lt; 0.001 (reject \\(H_0\\) of the ANOVA test). There is at least one condition with mean SAT score which is different from the other means.\nThis table also presents the eta squared (\\(\\eta^2 = 0.85\\)) , which expresses the proportion of variability explained by the group relative to the total variability:\n\\[\\eta^2 = \\frac{Sum \\ of \\ squares \\ group}{Total \\ sum \\ of \\ squares} = \\frac{230497}{230497 + 39771} = \\frac{230497}{270268}=0.85\\]\nA value of 0.85 (85%) means that 85% of the variation in SAT scores can be attributed to the preparation time and would be considered a large effect size. (NOTE: Whether the \\(\\eta^2\\) value is considered “high” or not is relative and depends on the research context).\n \n\n\n2.1.7 Post hoc tests\nClick the Post Hoc Tests, then highlight the group in the left panel and click it (or drug it) over the the right panel. Check Tukey correction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.16: Post Hoc Tests panels.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.17: Post Hoc Tests (Tukey correction).\n\n\n\n \n\nInterpretation\nAn analysis of variance showed that the amount of preparation for the SAT in which students engaged appeared to significantly affect their performances on the test, F(4, 30) = 43.47, p &lt; 0.001, \\(\\eta^2 = 0.85\\). Post-hoc analyses with Tukey’s test, adjusting p-values for multiple comparisons, indicated that each additional two months of study up to six months was associated with significantly higher SAT scores. However, there was no significant difference in scores between the six month and eight month study groups.",

    "text": "2.2 One-way within-subjects Analysis of Variance (repeated one-way ANOVA)\nThe one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (also known as a within-subjects ANOVA) is an extension of the paired t-test designed to assess whether there are significant differences in the means of three or more related groups, such as comparing the difference between three or more time points.\n\n2.2.1 Importing data\nIn hypothetical study, it is hoped that a certain drug will alleviate the intensity of symptoms of a certain disease. Symptom intensity was evaluated on a twelve-point scale with higher values indicating more intense symptoms. Two pre-treatment baseline measurements are made, the first a month prior to treatment and the second one week prior to treatment. Post-treatments measures of symptom intensity are made after one week, one month, and one year following administration of the drug. In this simplified example, we have eight patients in the study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.18: Table with raw data.\n\n\n\n\nOpen the dataset named “symptoms” from the file tab in the menu (Figure 2.19).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.19: The symptoms dataset.\n\n\n\n \nWe prepare the data as follows (Figure 2.20):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.20: The modified dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Research question\nA study investigated the effect of a drug on symptom intensity in a specific disease, assessing eight patients before (two pre-test baseline measures) and after treatment (three post-test measures).

In this case, we have to correct the degrees of freedom in repeated ANOVA analysis.\nThere are two correction options \\(\\epsilon\\) available: Greenhouse-Geisser (GGe), or Huynh-Feldt (HFe) (Figure 2.29). The general recommendation is to use the Greenhouse-Geisser \\(\\epsilon\\) correction when it is less than 0.75; otherwise, we should use the Huynh-Feldt \\(\\epsilon\\) correction.\nAs the GGe value is less than 0.75, we use the Greenhouse-Geisser adjustment of 0.488.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.29: Assumption selections for repeated ANOVA.\n\n\n\nThe corrected degrees of freedom are:\n\\(df_1*GGe=4*0.488=1.95\\)\nand\n\\(df_2*HFe=28*0.488=13.66\\).\n \nRepeated ANOVA table\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.30: Summary table of repeated ANOVA.\n\n\n\nAs we can see from Figure 2.30, the within-subjects variable was statisticaly significant under the Greenhouse-Geisser correction, F(1.95, 13.66) = 18.624, p &lt; 0.001, \\(\\eta^2_p = 0.727\\).\n\n\n2.2.7 Post hoc tests\nClick the Post Hoc Tests, then highlight the time in the left panel and click it (or drug it) over the the right panel.

Pairwise comparisons using a Bonferroni correction to maintain an alpha level of 0.05 revealed that intensity of symptoms remained constant from the two pre-test baseline measures, significantly decreased after a week following drug therapy, and further significantly decreased after one month. Symptom intensity did not significantly differ from that level at the end of a year.",
