This Menu is displayed at the very top of the Jamovi screen:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: The menu bar provides access to all functions of the program.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are six tabs in the Menu (from left to right): 1.

Let’s say that we want to study only the adults from the participants in this survey.\n\nSimple condition\n\nIn order to access functions, press the  icon in the filter settings and from “VARIABLES” double-click on age (or we just type the variable name but if the variable has a space, we must use ticks '' around the variable name). Then type the condition age &gt;= 18 in the formula box and press ENTER from the keyboard (Figure 1.17).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.17: Adding a filter.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelational (or comparison) operators in Jamovi\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsymbol\nread as\n\n\n\n\n&lt;\nless than\n\n\n&gt;\ngreater than\n\n\n==\nequal to\n\n\n&lt;=\nless than or equal to\n\n\n&gt;=\ngreater than or equal to\n\n\n!=\nnot equal to\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNotice that a column named Filter 1 has been added to the Spreadsheet view. Cells that meet the condition age &gt;= 18 are checked with a green tick , while the rest have a red x symbol . Lines with an X are grayed out indicating that these observations are now outside of the current dataset.\nThere is also a switch where we can activate  or inactivate  the filter (note that an inactivate filter will remain visible and can be toggled to active at any time).\nIt is also possible to hide all filter columns by clicking on the eye symbol  of the filters. In this case, all filters and the filtered data will remain active but will be invisible.\nFinally, if we want to delete the filter permanently, we can click on the  of the filter .\n \n\nMultiple conditions\n\nBut we can do more complicated filters than this! Let’s say that we’re interested in the adult females. In fact we can specify this in three ways:\na) by using the and operator in “Filter 1” which means that both conditions (adults and females) in the expression must be true at the same time. Therefore, we type the expression age &gt;= 18 and sex == 'female' (Figure 1.18):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.18: Combining conditions with “and” operator in one expression.\n\n\n\nNote that in the above expression we can also use double quotes around the \"female\" (i.e., age &gt;= 18 and sex == \"female\") or even the coded value (i.e., age &gt;= 18 and sex == 2).\nb) by adding the second condition (i.e. sex == \"female\") as another expression to “Filter 1” (by clicking the small + beside the first expression) (Figure 1.19):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.19: Multiple expressions in the same filter.\n\n\n\nThis additional expression comes to be represented with its own column F1(2) (Figure 1.19), and by looking at the ticks and crosses, we can see which expression is responsible for excluding each row.\nc) adding a new “Filter 2” (by selecting the large + to the left of the filters dialog box) (Figure 1.20). In this case, we can activate or inactivate the filters separately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.20: Multiple expressions using multiple filters.\n\n\n\nWe close the filter settings by pressing the arrow in the top-right corner .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nFilters in Jamovi exclude the rows for which the expression is not true. When filters are active, all results will be based on the filtered data. If we want to see unfiltered results we will either need to delete the filter or toggle it to inactive.",

    "section": "1.9 Transforming a variable",
    "text": "1.9 Transforming a variable\n\n1.9.1 Transform a quantitative variable into a qualitative variable\nSometimes it can be useful to convert a quantitative variable into a qualitative variable with levels. For example, the time_spent can be categorized as follows:\n\nless than or equal to 3  “0-3”\n4 to 7  “4-7”\n8 to 11  “8-11”\ngreater than 11  “&gt;11”\n\nSelect time_spent variable and click the Transform button  from the toolbar of the Data tab. This opens the “TRANSFORMED VARIABLE” view, where we can set the name of the transformed variable such as time_spent2 and create the transformation. To do this, select the source variable, the time_spent in this case, in the Source Variable field and create a new transformation using transform field (Figure 1.21), which is initially set to ‘none’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.21: Setting up a new transformation of a variable.\n\n\n\n \nThis opens the “TRANSFORM” view where Jamovi gives each transformation a name (e.g., Transform 1; if we want we can change it). This allows us to use it again later on other variables if we wish. We can also add a description (Figure 1.22).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.22: Box for adding conditions to the transformation.\n\n\n\nNow we need to add conditions. Jamovi uses simple if ... else statements and executes each statement starting from the top. So let’s start!\nFirst, select + Add recode condition. Second, we need to fill the boxes with the information as follows (Figure 1.23):\n\nThe $source is the variable we want to transform (here time_spent)- don’t change this.\nSelect the appropriate comparison operator (here &lt;= )\nIn the next box, we will put the time_spent value we want as the cut off point (e.g., 3).\nAfter the use, add our new label (here '0-3'). If we are using text we must enclose it in '...'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.23: Adding the first condition (0-3).\n\n\n\n \nWe can add as many conditions as we want by selecting + Add recode condition. This will add a new if $source line into the box (Figure 1.24). Remember they will be executed in order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.24: Adding the second condition (4-7).\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.25: Adding the third condition (8-11).\n\n\n\n \nFinally, after the else use box just add the label for the data that does not meet the above conditions (here '&gt;11'), as shown in Figure 1.26.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.26: Adding the final label for the data that does not meet the above conditions (&gt;11).\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1.9.2 Reverse scoring of items\nTo compute the total score for all items of the RSES, we first need to reverse the scores of the negatively worded questions (3, 5, 8, 9, and 10). To do this, we can follow these simple steps.\nIn the Variables tab, we select the checkboxes for the q3, q5, q8, q9, and q10 variables, as shown in Figure 1.27.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.27: Select the variables to be reversed.\n\n\n\n \nAfter that, we click on the Transform button ) from the toolbar of the Variables tab to open the Transform variable settings. Then, we Create New Transform, as shown in Figure 1.28.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.28: Open the Transform variable settings.\n\n\n\n \nIn the Transform view, we enter _R as a suffix for the variable names and specify 3-$source in the condition box, as shown in Figure 1.29.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.29: Transform variable settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.30: Data with the reversed variables.",
